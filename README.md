# 05 Day Planner

## Description

- Why did you build this project?  
  A simple app to plan your day-to-day activities, meetings, etc.
Set in the common 9-5 workday, so sorry to all you nocturnals, out there(me included)!
 
- (What did you learn?)  
  I've strenghtened my knowledge and application of JQuery and using it in conjunction with vanilla  
JavaScript functions to creat dynamic styling to individual elements. As well as saving and retrieving
data from the local storage of the client's machine. Pretty cool.


## Usage
  Type your appointments or any content into the text field of the corresponding hour you wish to  
save it to, and make sure to hit the save button once you're done!
Each field has its own saved data, so you're free to delete past or future events without messing up  
the other time blocks.
